# Flext

A bunch of extensions for Flutter and some packages (`go_router` and
`flutter_bloc`).

## Getting started

Install the package by running the following command:

```bash
flutter pub add flext
```

Then you can import the package and use all the exported extensions.

## Features

This package exports all the extensions contained in the following packages:

- [flext_core](https://pub.dev/packages/flext_core)
- [flext_go_router](https://pub.dev/packages/flext_go_router)
- [flext_flutter_bloc](https://pub.dev/packages/flext_flutter_bloc)

Check directly the documentation of each package to see what extensions are
available.

If you need to use only some of the extensions, you can import the corresponding
package instead of this one.
